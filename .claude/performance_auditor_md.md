**Performance Optimization Strategies**:

*Database Optimization Patterns:*
```sql
-- Optimize product search with proper indexing
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_products_search_gin 
ON products USING gin(to_tsvector('english', name || ' ' || description));

-- Optimize transaction queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_transactions_store_date 
ON transactions(store_id, transaction_date DESC);

-- Optimize customer lookup
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_customers_email_phone 
ON customers(email, phone_number);

-- Partition large tables for performance
CREATE TABLE transactions_2024 PARTITION OF transactions 
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');
```

*API Optimization Patterns:*
```typescript
// Implement efficient caching
const getCachedProducts = async (storeId: string) => {
  const cacheKey = `products:${storeId}`;
  const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey);
  
  if (cached) {
    return JSON.parse(cached);
  }
  
  const products = await db.products.findMany({
    where: { storeId, isActive: true },
    select: {
      id: true,
      name: true,
      price: true,
      quantity: true
    }
  });
  
  await redis.setex(cacheKey, 300, JSON.stringify(products)); // 5min cache
  return products;
};

// Optimize database queries with strategic includes
const getTransactionWithDetails = async (transactionId: string) => {
  return await db.transaction.findUnique({
    where: { id: transactionId },
    include: {
      lineItems: {
        include: {
          product: {
            select: { name: true, sku: true }
          }
        }
      },
      customer: {
        select: { firstName: true, lastName: true, email: true }
      }
    }
  });
};
```

*Frontend Optimization Patterns:*
```typescript
// Optimize React rendering with memoization
const ProductCard = React.memo(({ product, onAddToCart }) => {
  const handleAddToCart = useCallback(() => {
    onAddToCart(product.id);
  }, [product.id, onAddToCart]);
  
  return (
    <div data-testid={`sales-product-card-${product.id}`}>
      <img src={product.imageUrl} alt={product.name} loading="lazy" />
      <h3>{product.name}</h3>
      <p>${product.price}</p>
      <button onClick={handleAddToCart}>Add to Cart</button>
    </div>
  );
});

// Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
const VirtualizedProductGrid = ({ products }) => {
  const itemRenderer = useCallback(({ index, style }) => (
    <div style={style}>
      <ProductCard product={products[index]} />
    </div>
  ), [products]);
  
  return (
    <FixedSizeGrid
      columnCount={4}
      columnWidth={250}
      height={600}
      rowCount={Math.ceil(products.length / 4)}
      rowHeight={300}
      itemData={products}
    >
      {itemRenderer}
    </FixedSizeGrid>
  );
};
```

**Performance Testing Scenarios**:

*Black Friday Load Test:*
```typescript
// Simulate peak retail traffic
const blackFridayLoadTest = async () => {
  const scenarios = [
    {
      name: 'concurrent_transactions',
      users: 50, // 50 concurrent cashiers
      duration: '10m',
      transactions_per_minute: 200
    },
    {
      name: 'product_search_heavy',
      users: 100, // Heavy product searching
      duration: '5m',
      searches_per_minute: 1000
    },
    {
      name: 'payment_processing_spike',
      users: 25, // Payment processing spike
      duration: '3m',
      payments_per_minute: 150
    }
  ];
  
  const results = await Promise.all(
    scenarios.map(scenario => runLoadTest(scenario))
  );
  
  return analyzePerformanceResults(results);
};
```

*Transaction Speed Test:*
```typescript
// Measure complete transaction performance
const measureTransactionSpeed = async () => {
  const startTime = performance.now();
  
  // Step 1: Add products to cart
  const addToCartTime = await measureStep(async () => {
    await addProductToCart('product-123', 2);
    await addProductToCart('product-456', 1);
  });
  
  // Step 2: Calculate taxes and totals
  const taxCalculationTime = await measureStep(async () => {
    await calculateTransactionTotals();
  });
  
  // Step 3: Process age verification
  const ageVerificationTime = await measureStep(async () => {
    await verifyCustomerAge(customerId);
  });
  
  // Step 4: Process payment
  const paymentTime = await measureStep(async () => {
    await processPayment({
      amount: totalAmount,
      paymentMethod: 'CARD',
      terminalId: 'terminal-123'
    });
  });
  
  const totalTime = performance.now() - startTime;
  
  return {
    totalTime,
    breakdown: {
      addToCart: addToCartTime,
      taxCalculation: taxCalculationTime,
      ageVerification: ageVerificationTime,
      payment: paymentTime
    }
  };
};
```

**Performance Monitoring Setup**:

*Real-time Performance Dashboard:*
```typescript
// Performance metrics collection
const collectPerformanceMetrics = async () => {
  const metrics = {
    // API performance
    apiResponseTimes: await getApiResponseTimes(),
    apiThroughput: await getApiThroughput(),
    apiErrorRates: await getApiErrorRates(),
    
    // Database performance
    dbQueryTimes: await getDatabaseQueryTimes(),
    dbConnectionPool: await getConnectionPoolStats(),
    dbSlowQueries: await getSlowQueries(),
    
    // System resources
    memoryUsage: process.memoryUsage(),
    cpuUsage: await getCpuUsage(),
    eventLoopLag: await getEventLoopLag(),
    
    // Business metrics
    transactionThroughput: await getTransactionThroughput(),
    averageTransactionTime: await getAverageTransactionTime(),
    paymentSuccessRate: await getPaymentSuccessRate()
  };
  
  // Send to monitoring service
  await sendMetricsToMonitoring(metrics);
  
  // Check for performance alerts
  await checkPerformanceAlerts(metrics);
  
  return metrics;
};
```

*Performance Alert Thresholds:*
```typescript
const performanceAlerts = {
  criticalThresholds: {
    apiResponseTime: 2000, // 2 seconds
    databaseQueryTime: 1000, // 1 second
    transactionProcessingTime: 5000, // 5 seconds
    memoryUsage: 512 * 1024 * 1024, // 512 MB
    cpuUsage: 80, // 80%
    errorRate: 5 // 5%
  },
  warningThresholds: {
    apiResponseTime: 1000, // 1 second
    databaseQueryTime: 500, // 500ms
    transactionProcessingTime: 3000, // 3 seconds
    memoryUsage: 256 * 1024 * 1024, // 256 MB
    cpuUsage: 60, // 60%
