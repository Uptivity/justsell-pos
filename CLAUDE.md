2. Start databases: `docker-compose up -d`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Generate Prisma client: `npx prisma generate`
5. Run database migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`

## Build and Test Commands

### Development
- `npm run dev` - Start Vite dev server (http://localhost:5173)
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Testing
- `npm run test` - Run all Jest tests
- `npm run test:unit` - Run unit tests only
- `npm run test:integration` - Run integration tests only
- `npm run test:e2e` - Run Playwright E2E tests
- `npm run test:e2e:install` - Install Playwright browsers

### Database
- `npx prisma migrate dev` - Create and apply migrations
- `npx prisma generate` - Generate Prisma client
- `npx prisma studio` - Open Prisma Studio GUI

## **CRITICAL: Task List Management (MANDATORY)**

**EVERY Claude Code session MUST:**
1. **Check TASKS.md at start** - Review current sprint focus and next pending tasks
2. **Update TASKS.md continuously** - Mark completed tasks ✅, add new tasks discovered
3. **Update session tracker** - Record progress, issues found, quality gate status  
4. **Mark task status** - Use ✅/🔄/⏳/🔴/📝 status indicators consistently
5. **Document completion** - Add completion dates, notes, and verification steps

**Task Status Discipline:**
- ✅ = Completed and verified with all quality gates passing
- 🔄 = In Progress (currently being worked on)  
- ⏳ = Pending (not yet started)
- 🔴 = Blocked/Failed (document blockers and resolution steps)
- 📝 = Needs Review (waiting for sub-agent review)

**Session Continuity:** ALWAYS continue from where the previous session left off using the session tracker in TASKS.md.
