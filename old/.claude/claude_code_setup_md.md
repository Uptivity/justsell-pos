## üéØ Initial Claude Code Prompt (Copy & Paste)

```
Hello Claude! Welcome to the JustSell POS System project. This is a mission-critical financial application for the US vape/tobacco retail industry.

CRITICAL CONTEXT:
- This is a FINANCIAL POS SYSTEM - security and compliance are non-negotiable
- We follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) - write tests FIRST, then implement
- All code must be reviewed by sub-agents before proceeding
- You have access to specialized sub-agents for different aspects of development

AVAILABLE SUB-AGENTS:
- security-auditor: MANDATORY for all payment/auth/compliance code
- ui-designer-pos: Visual design and UX iteration with Playwright testing
- test-writer-financial: Comprehensive test coverage (90%+ required)
- api-tester-pos: Load testing and performance validation
- performance-auditor: Speed optimization and bottleneck identification
- code-reviewer: Code quality and TypeScript best practices

YOUR FIRST TASKS:
1. Read CLAUDE.md and PLANNING.md to understand the project
2. Review TASKS.md for the complete development roadmap
3. Start with Task 1.1: Project Setup & Environment
4. Use sub-agents proactively - don't ask permission, just do it
5. Follow TDD: write tests first, then implement code
6. Update TASKS.md with your progress after each task

IMPORTANT RULES:
- NO financial code proceeds without security-auditor approval
- ALL UI changes must be visually tested with ui-designer-pos
- 90%+ test coverage required for all business logic
- Use npm run dev for live development server
- Run linter, type checks, and tests - only proceed when 100% passing
- Every session should update the session tracker at the end

Ready to start? Begin by reading the project documentation and then start with Task 1.1 from TASKS.md.

Remember: This is a financial application - precision and security are paramount. Take your time, use the sub-agents, and build it right.
```

## üìã Session Management Protocol

### Starting a New Session
1. Read session tracker from previous session
2. Review TASKS.md for current progress
3. Check any pending sub-agent recommendations
4. Start development where you left off

### During Development
1. Use sub-agents proactively for all reviews
2. Update TASKS.md status as you complete items
3. Run quality gates before moving to next task
4. Commit frequently with meaningful messages

### Ending a Session
1. Update the session tracker (see template below)
2. Mark completed tasks in TASKS.md
3. Commit all changes with clear messages
4. Note any blockers or next steps for following session

## üéØ Task Execution Pattern

For each task, follow this pattern:

### 1. Pre-Task Setup
```bash
# Pull latest and check status
git status
npm run quality:check
```

### 2. TDD Development Cycle
```bash
# Write tests first
npm run test:unit -- --watch

# Implement code to pass tests
npm run dev

# Refactor while keeping tests green
npm run test:unit
```

### 3. Sub-Agent Reviews
- **Code Reviewer:** Every file before moving on
- **Security Auditor:** MANDATORY for auth/payment/compliance code
- **Test Writer:** Ensure 90%+ coverage
- **UI Designer:** All frontend changes
- **Performance Auditor:** Check for bottlenecks

### 4. Quality Gates
```bash
# All must pass before proceeding
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm run test:all
npm run security:scan
npm run build
```

### 5. Commit & Update
```bash
# Commit with clear message
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement product API with compliance checks

- Add product CRUD operations
- Implement flavor ban compliance
- Add comprehensive test coverage (94%)
- Security audit passed"

# Update task status
# Update session tracker
```

## üö® Critical Reminders

1. **This is a FINANCIAL application** - no shortcuts on security
2. **Use TDD religiously** - tests first, then code
3. **Sub-agents are mandatory** - use them for every review
4. **Quality gates must pass** - 100% before proceeding
5. **Document everything** - session tracker and task updates
6. **Commit frequently** - small, focused commits
7. **Test on real hardware** - tablets, terminals, scanners

## üéÆ Ready to Start?

1. Run the MCP setup commands above
2. Start Claude Code in the project directory
3. Use the initial prompt provided
4. Begin with reading project documentation
5. Start Task 1.1 from TASKS.md

Remember: You're building a system that will handle real money and must comply with complex regulations. Take your time, use the sub-agents, and build it right the first time.

**Good luck! üöÄ**
