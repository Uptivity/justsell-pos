# Ransomware Resilience
- Prevent: patch cadence <= 7d (High), least privilege, block risky attachments.
- Detect: EDR mass-encrypt patterns; egress anomaly; honeytokens.
- Respond: isolate; rotate creds; invalidate tokens; disable integrations; notify partners.
- Recover: restore from clean snapshot; verify checksums; blameless postmortem with actions.
